Every time when I read news online it feels like I’m wasting my time. Quite often articles I come across are shallow and full of silly comments. Nine times out of ten I forget what I’ve just read in a minute. Do you have the same feeling? Do you crave good source of news? In this case ‘Hacker news’ website is for you.

[Hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com) was initially created back in 2007. Originally it was mostly focused on comp¬uter science and entrepreneurship. However, in addition to posting articles for geeks it aggregates news from various respected sources on other topics. Intention at the moment is to post practically "anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity".

The game-changing feature for me is that application is meticulous about showing news sorted according to the points received from the community members. You are bound to find most important and outstanding news on the top. To get the most out of the website you need to read comments right after an article. If an article is about a scientific discovery, you’ll find comments from people researching in that field. If it’s about a Tesla car, you might find a comment from an engineer working there. Sometimes comments are more interesting than an article itself!

All in all, it’s quite challenging to find a good source of news that everybody enjoys. But, if you ask me, it’s worth trying something new. That’s why I highly recommend checking out ‘Hacker news’. Enjoy!
